# SPI Driver asynchronous - Self loopback multi client

This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to achieve self-loop back between multiple clients

## Description

- This example writes and reads back the same data (self loop back) for two different clients connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of the driver

- It uses the request (write and read request) queuing feature of the asynchronous driver and does not waste CPU bandwidth in waiting for previous request completion

- The example also demonstrates how to setup two different client transfers at different baud rates

- This example performs self loop back only once after a power on reset
- Success is indicated when a successful self loop back is reported by both the clients
- After the loop back test is complete, the application remains in the idle state

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_rh71_ek.X | SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit |
|||

### Setting up SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit

- Connect the J15 USB port on the board to the computer using a mini USB cable
- Use jumper wire to Connect "Pin 16 of J24 header" to "Pin 17 of J24 header" 
    - FLEXCOM2_IO0 signal as MOSI signal and it is mapped to PA2 that is routed to "Pin 16 of J24 header" 
    - FLEXCOM2_IO1 signal as MISO signal and it is mapped to PA6 that is routed to "Pin 17 of J24 header" 
    - Connect debugger to the 20-pin JTAG header J33.

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
